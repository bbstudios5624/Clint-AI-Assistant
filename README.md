# Clint-AI-Assistant

The Clint AI Assistant is a complex computer program written in python to advance the knowledge of artificial intelligence. This computer program can do a lot of tasks only with voice command. The computer program ia finished only within 250 lines of python code. 10+ useful tasks are added to make the program more realistic and entertaining. Also, comments are added for better understanding of computer programmers. The IDE used for this project is Microsoft Visual Studio Code. Python 3.6.0 is used as the python interpreter.

The project is made in Windows 10 Home Operating System in a HP Laptop. No advanced specifications are used for this project. Some of the PC Specifications of the development computer are :

PC Type : HP Notebook
  , Processor : Intel Core i3 9th Generation
  , Graphics Card (Integrated GPU) : Intel HD Graphics Card
  , Graphics Card (Dedicated GPU) : AMD Radeon 5500 Graphics Card
  , Ram : 8GB Ram
  , Storage : 1 TB Internal HDD
  , Operating System : Windows 10 Home Single Language

Also, a Snake Game feature is added in the project to make the software more realistic. Users can trigger the game feature by simply saying 'game' to AI Assistant. More than 8 Python Libraries are used in this project. Some of the Python Libraries used are :

pyttsx3 - For the AI Voice(Microsoft David)
  , datetime - For recognising the current date and time
  , sys - for killing the computer program
  , webbrowser - for searching information on the webbrowser
  , wikipedia - for searching information on the wikipedia
  , speechRecognition - for recognising our speech and sending it to Google for recognition
  , square, vector - for the snake game, it is used to make the structure of the snake and food
  , pygame - the most basic Python game library for python game development

BB Studios was deciding to sell the project to a single user for $25. But, they thought that knowledge is greater than money. So, they uploaded the full source code to Microsoft Github for open-source distribution.
